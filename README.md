# CLEN 4XXX: Metaphor and Media

Spring 2018  
Prof. Dennis Tenen | dt2406 at columbia  

This course offers a survey of major works on metaphor, beginning with
Aristotle and ending with contemporary cognitive and media theory. Appropriate
for both undergraduate and graduate students, our sessions will involve weekly
discussion and an occasional "lab" component, in which we will test our
theoretical intuitions against case studies of literary metaphor and metaphor
in the fields of law, medicine, philosophy, and design.

I am particularly interested in ways metaphors "break" or "die," whether from
disuse, overuse, or misapplication. In their classical sense, metaphors work
by ferrying meaning across from one domain to another. For example, by calling
a rooster "the trumpet of the morn," Shakespeare means to suggest a structural
similarity between horn instruments and birds. Note that this similarity
cannot pertain to the objects in their totality. The analogy applies to the
call of the bird only or perhaps to the resemblance between a beak and the
flute of a trumpet. The metaphor would also fail were we to find no
perceivable analogies between birds and trumpets. Similarly, computer users
who empty their virtual "trash bins" are promised the erasure of underlying
data. The course will conclude by examining the metaphors implicit such media
transformations.

## Course Requirements & Grading

Students will be expected to read the approximate equivalent of three
scholarly articles per week, to attend the seminar weekly, and to participate
in the class discussion both in person and online. A midterm and final exams
will reward those who keep up with the readings. Advanced students will have
the option to integrate the course's themes with the subject matter of their
expertise.

have to take the midterm and the final exams.

## University Policies

When in doubt, cite! Plagiarism is insulting to your fellow students, your
instructors, and to the research community at large. It wastes my time and
yours, and is, ultimately, not worth the risk. Consult Columbia’s guidelines
at <http://www.college.columbia.edu/academics/integrity> or ask me for help
early in the writing process.

## Resources

The syllabus is continually updated to match the pace of the course on our
[GitHub page](https://github.com/denten-courses/metaphor-media). Weekly
responses to the readings are due on Piazza. Please submit all homework
assignments to the appropriate folder in Courseworks.
